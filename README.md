# Raspberry Pi Pico 2020 Software & Hardware Integration 

A project that connects the raspberry pi light to a WPF software focusing on the software side rather than the hardware side. 
Utilise WPF to create a UI coded in .xaml and C# that interacts with the backend Raspberry PI coded in C++ 

To be improved on : 

1. make it MVVM 
2. make it OOD

## User Instruction: 

### Mounting a device 

**Manually if your system doesnt automatically:**

To show the last few kernel messages 
```bash
dmesg | tail 
```

Create a file in mnt ( mount - temporary location to attach file system ) ( -p make sure parent /mnt is there else fail )
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/pico 
```

Mount the sda1 ( scsi disk , a the order detected , 1 the partition ) from dev ( device entry points into devices managed by the kernel ) 
```bash
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/pico
```
Now when you go into /mnt/pico you should see the files of pico 

Then all you need to do is copy your existing .uf2 file into /mnt/pico
```bash
sudo cp filename.uf2 /mnt/pico
```
After doing that your /mnt/pico device should be gone as its not detected as a filesystem anymore ( It's disconnected )

Else if its still there do : 
```bash
sudo sync
sudo umount /mnt/pico
```

But ussually it should unmount on its own 

### Create your .uf2 file

**Three main of doing that:** 

1. Thornny: ( Python )
Essentially just drag and drop, self explainatory

2. Visual Studio Code Extension: ( C/C++ )
Download the RaspberryPi Extension then press the button and follow the instruction, then compile it 

3. Manually Flashing it: ( C/C++ )
mkdir a new folder 
gitclone the raspberrypi repo 
cp the Cmakelist.txt out 
install all the require compiler 
then compile it 
it should create a build folder 
then 
.make the build to create the .uf2 file 

### Flashing your file into the device 
Press the button of your device so it go into BOOTSEL mode
While holding the button plug in your usb into it
